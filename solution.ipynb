    "# Introduction\n",
    "For those unacquainted, this is a jupyter notebook, a fairly popular and useful tool for interactive prototyping, data inspection, developing and documenting. Its content is partitioned into cells that can either contain markdown text or executable code, and further supports inline/in-cell vizualization of both plots and complex collections. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this notebook is to provide a quick start for loading, processing and inspecting the data. Python-users  are free, and encouraged, to base their initial data exploration on this notebook, and everyone else are encouraged to take inspiration from the notebook when starting out in their language of choice. Particularly, the dataset placement and loading is important to get right in order to not check it into your own forked repositories. "

If you know what you are doing, you can always just keep the data outside of the repository or extend the gitignore to ignore other locations within it. "

    "Given the observations above, a simple idea is to simply drop all data after a cut-off point beginning with the problematic date 2021-09-14, as this only makes out a couple of months out of 12 years of data. The remaining NaNs are exclusively caused by the switch to daylight saving and the entire timestamp does not really exist within the timezone. As long as the dataset does not provide absolute timestamps, the simplest course of action is likely to just fill in the NaNs using linear interpolation or back/front fill. **Note:** That the raw data likely has overwritten datapoints when switching from daylight saving in the autumn as well. All in all, these two abnormalities should not affect any models too much, and if you do not want to spend time on more advanced processing, it should be safe to use this."
